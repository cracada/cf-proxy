**Booster.js** is a speed and performance optimizier for your website, delivering fast web experiences to users. Built with Cloudflare Workers, it caches static assets on the high performance global network, applies optimizations to web pages, and guards your website from scrapers or malicious attacks.

- Speed: Deliver your website with Cloudflareâ€™s global network, which is milliseconds away from virtually every Internet user.
- Network: Set up HTTP/2, TLS 1.3, HTTPS (Free SSL Certificate), and IPv6 for your website.
- Optimization: Minify JavaScript codes, compress images, cache static assets.
- Firewall: Block traffics from specific IP addresses, regions, or known scrapers.
- Routes: Serve different webpages to visitors based on their region or devices.
- Serverless: No virtual machines, no servers, and no containers to maintain.
- Todo: Load balancer, HTMLRewriter, and advanced routing rules.

## Deploy manually

1. Navigate to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com), register or sign in your Cloudflare account, and set custom subdomain for workers, and create a new Worker.

2. Customize [booster.js](https://github.com/OshekharO/CF-REVERSE-PROXY/blob/main/Script/viperadnan/booster.js), paste the code into Cloudflare online editor to replace the default one.

3. Change the name of your Worker, save and deploy the code.

### Bind to Custom Domain

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare.

2. Navigate to the dashboard, select 'Workers' page, and click on 'Add Route'.

3. Type `https://<domain_name>/*` in `Route` and select the Worker you've created.

4. Add a CNAME DNS record for your custom domain. Input the subdomain (Example: `@` or `www`) in the 'Name' field, input the **second level domain** of your workers (Example: `readme.workers.dev`) in the 'Target' field, and then set 'Proxy status' to 'Proxied'.
